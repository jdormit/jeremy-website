* Jeremy Dormitzer's personal website
This is my personal website. It's written using the [[https://docs.racket-lang.org/pollen/index.html][Pollen static site generator]].

* Running the development server
Make sure you have Pollen installed, then run:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  raco pollen start
#+END_SRC

* Building the3 static site
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  raco pollen publish src out
#+END_SRC
