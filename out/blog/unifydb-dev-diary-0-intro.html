      <h1>unifyDB Dev Diary 0: I’m building a database!</h1>
      <p>Phew, it’s been a while! Over a year, in fact. And what a wild year! Lots of good things happened: I got married, got a new job that I love, moved to a nice new apartment. Also some not-so-nice things, but since you are all living through 2020 just like me I don’t think I need to go into those. But I have still found some side-project time, and I’d like to start talking about what I’m building.</p>
      <p>So – I’m excited to announce that I’m building a database! I’m calling it unifyDB. It’s going to be a general-purpose database with some pretty interesting properties:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>It maintains a complete history of changes to all entities stored in the database</li>
        <li>You can make queries for historical data, e.g. “what did this user record look like last Tuesday?”</li>
        <li>Arbitrary metadata can be attached to transactions – for example, you can add an application user ID to every transaction your app makes</li>
        <li>Fine-grained access control is built into the database, allowing developers to limit access to particular attributes across all entities</li>
      </ul>
      <p>This is the database that I’ve always wanted – basically, I’m tired of being in meetings where the boss says “who changed this user’s email address?” and everyone just looks at each other and shrugs.</p>
      <p>I’m designing unifyDB to be as modular as possible – I want it to be as easy to run it as a single node on your local machine as it is to run in an autoscaling cluster on your cloud of choice.</p>
      <p>I’ve actually been working on this on and off for over a year. The code lives in <a href="https://github.com/unifydb/unifydb">a GitHub repository</a>. Fair warning: it’s mostly undocumented and nowhere close to being finished. So far, I’ve written the query engine, the transaction handler, the web server (yes, it has an HTTP interface), and a bunch of underlying infrastructure. So as it currently stands, unifyDB is able to store data (in-memory since I haven’t built the storage layer yet) and issue history-aware queries. I’m in the middle of writing the authentication mechanism. After that, it’s on to the storage layer, then most likely the access control layer.</p>
      <p>I’m going to start publishing monthly development diaries detailing the more interesting aspects of database. I’ll start with a post about the query system implementation sometime in the next couple of weeks. Sound interesting?
