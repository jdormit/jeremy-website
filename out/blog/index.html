      <h2>unifyDB Dev Diary 1: the query system</h2>
      <p>Posted on October 2, 2020</p>
      <p>This is the first development diary for the database I'm writing, unifyDB. I wrote a brief introduction to the project here. In this post I'm going to talk about unifyDB's query system: what it does and how it works.</p>

      <h2>unifyDB Dev Diary 0: I’m building a database!</h2>
      <p>Posted on August 8, 2020</p>
      <p>Phew, it’s been a while! Over a year, in fact. And what a wild year! Lots of good things happened: I got married, got a new job that I love, moved to a nice new apartment. Also some not-so-nice things, but since you are all living through 2020 just like me I don’t think I need to go into those. But I have still found some side-project time, and I’d like to start talking about what I’m building.</p>

      <h2>ActivityPub: Good enough for jazz</h2>
      <p>Posted on January 6, 2019</p>
      <p>Kaniini, one of the lead developers of Pleroma, recently published a blog post called ActivityPub: The “Worse is Better” Approach to Federated Social Networking. It’s a critique of the security and safety of the ActivityPub protocol. They make some good points:</p>

      <h2>Announcing Pterotype</h2>
      <p>Posted on November 14, 2018</p>
      <p>In my last post, I wrote about an emerging web standard called ActivityPub that lets web services interoperate and form a federated, open social network. I made an argument about how important this new standard is – how it tears down walled gardens, discourages monopolies and centralization, and encourages user freedom.</p>

      <h2>What is ActivityPub, and how will it change the internet?</h2>
      <p>Posted on September 14, 2018</p>
      <p>There’s a new social network in town. It’s called Mastodon. You might have even heard of it. On the surface, Mastodon feels a lot like Twitter: you post “toots” up to 500 characters; you follow other users who say interesting things; you can favorite a toot or re-post it to your own followers. But Mastodon is different from Twitter in some fundamental ways. It offers many more ways for users to control the posts they see. It fosters awareness of the effect your posts have on others through a…</p>

      <h2>A DSL for music</h2>
      <p>Posted on August 4, 2018</p>
      <p>I recently discovered Haskell School of Music. It’s a book about algorithmic music, which is awesome because: a) I’ve been obsessed with procedural generation for years and b) I like music as much as I like programming. So you can imagine my excitement when I discovered that someone had written a textbook combining my favorite areas of study.</p>
